# Dia-Vision

Very often in the practice of working with paper documents, we are faced with the task of translating a graph into a computer format, but is it long and difficult to use expensive programs for digitization? Dia Vision is designed just for such cases. This is an application that will scan the graph using a smartphone camera, find the manuals and save it in a convenient format. This application is practical for businessmen, secretaries, office workers and others. Dia Vision allows you to save a lot of time and focus more on your work. Our product does not require powerful smartphone resources, as it is built on a client-server model, thanks to which the smartphone simply sends the recognized image to the server, which already returns the converted graph. There are no such simple and convenient analogues of Dia Vision, the market niche is free, which will allow you to fill it with author's products and popularize the technology. In the future, it is planned to develop a package of tools that will facilitate work with the help of artificial intelligence.
